#Value is a shared memory 
'''
value and Value are different in Python's multiprocessing module.

ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Value and value:

##Value (with uppercase 'V')
"multiprocessing.Value" is a class used to create a shared variable between processes.

Example:
balance = multiprocessing.Value('i', 200)  # 'i' means integer type


##value (with lowercase 'v')
".value" is an attribute of a 'multiprocessing.Value' object. It is used to access or modify the stored value.

Example:
balance.value += 1  # Access and update the shared variable

ðŸ”¹ Summary
âœ… Value('i', 200) â†’ Creates a shared memory variable.
âœ… balance.value â†’ Accesses or modifies the stored integer in shared memory.

 So, Value is a method (class), and value is an attribute of the shared variable!
